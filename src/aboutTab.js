                              The methods and technologies in the field evolve rapidly as well as the methods for creating value from that data.
                              As a result we are also familiar with pandas, PyMC, SciPy, ScikitLearn and R. Many of our models are initiated in

                               Hammerdirt was started in 2014. A response to the alarming rates of plastic pollution in the ocean. At that
                               time the crisis was focussed on the Pacific and Atlantic gyres, not upstream in Switzerland. In 2014 there were
                               also changes in the analytics fields and data-science became a common term.

                               Hammerdirt is a non-profit association that collects and manages observations. These observations
                               are primarily in the environmental domain. Our biggest project to date was IQAASL, the national
                               litter survey of Swiss rivers and lakes. This project was mandated by the federal government, the report
                               gave rise to a <a href={"https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/fr/home/themes/dechets.html"}> dedicated theme </a>
                               within the Swiss Federal Office of the Environment.
